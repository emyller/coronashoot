A not-so-realistic shooter game in which you have to kill viruses.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

---

## Plot

A young and exhausted programmer -- as redundant as it sounds -- got this weird
gig at a sketchy freelancing website: kill viruses. She has been offered an
irrefusable -- but also sketchy -- hourly rate to do the impossible contribution
to Dr. Vikron's research. Prior to starting her journey, she leaked the
following transcripted recording to her friends and family:

- Hi, I'm Ramona, you're Dr. Vic... Vikren...
- There's your gear inside that shiny green box right there.
- Wait what is it I'm going to do?
- Kill viruses in lab rats.
- Wait, what? How?
- Attacking them on close combat.
- Oooh like that movie Ant-Dude?
- Ant-what? No, ants are still too big for rats. Also that's impossible. You
  will pilot a drone.
- Well isn't a drone still too b...
- It doesn't matter, let's get started before the government kills the poor rat
  with chloroquine.

She dresses up the gear and suddenly finds herself inside the rat. The tech
gadget equips a underdeveloped laser gun she will use to blow viruses out of
their pseudo-life. Ramona is lucky because her new colleague, the friendly Dr.
Vikron, feeds the rat with experimental boosts and power ups she can use to win
the war against that terrible menace.
